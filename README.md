# About

Hey, I'm @begulathemoai !
I'm a newbie programmer and I like making small games and projects to challenge myself.
I started learning programming with Scratch, and then moved onto Python and GDScript.
I would also like to try and learn JavaScript (idk seems pretty versatile and making stuff move on web pages is cool, only problem is it looks horrible to learn)

# Activity

Right now I'm making a small game to learn GDScript and Godot in general (i picked godot bc GDScript has many similarities to Python compared to C# for Unity and whatever language is for UE)
